Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Step 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
